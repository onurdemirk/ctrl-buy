## Overview

CtrlBuy is a modern, responsive game store built with React and Vite. It features client-side routing via `react-router-dom` and modular styling using CSS Modules. The application includes:

- A fixed left navigation menu
- A dynamic games listing page with category filtering
- Detailed game pages
- A shopping cart for adding and reviewing selected games
